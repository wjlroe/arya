Arya is a tool to collect stats from your coding activities so you can track how awesome or not you are.

## Features:

* Understands a variety of test/compile outputs
* Creates CSVs per project
* Uploads your stats to arya-codestats site so you can code anywhere and see the results anywhere

## Installation:

Same as any Go project really:

* [Install Go](http://golang.org/doc/install.html), if you haven't already.
* Then run `goinstall github.com/wjlroe/arya`
* Or (probably more sensible), clone this repository and type `make`
* You now have a binary, called arya, that you can copy or link somewhere in your $PATH. I'd recommend ~/bin but that's just me.

## Usage:

Using Arya is really simple, as it should be.
